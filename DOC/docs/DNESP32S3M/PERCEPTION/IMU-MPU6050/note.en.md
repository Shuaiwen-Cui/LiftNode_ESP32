# MPU6050 

## Introduction

MPU6050 is a six-axis sensor that integrates a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer. It can communicate with the main control chip through the I2C interface. MPU6050 adopts digital output, which can directly output raw data, or output filtered data through the internal digital filter.
