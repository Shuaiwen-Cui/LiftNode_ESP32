# NOTE

!!! note
    WiFi is a builtin function for almost all ESP32 dev boards. It works in either "AP (Access Point)" or "STA (Station)" mode or simultaneously in both modes. Herein, we mainly use the ESP32 as a station to connect to the router and access the Internet.

!!! tip
    Normal wifi connection method can be easily found on the internet. Herein, we make the node working in AP mode and connect to enterprise wifi network like campus wifi. Specifically, we use the WPA2 Enterprise mode with PEAP-MSCHAPV2 authentication.

For more information about ESP32 WIFI features, check the following site (my another project for ESP32 study).
